## User Manual
This repo contains four different implementations of a dynamic list along with suitable unit tests for each of them. Our code is organized into five folders. 

The four implementation folders are identical in structure, containing source code written in c and assisted by header files, a *DETAILS.md* file dicussing the implementation details of each dynamic list strategy, and a *PROOFS.md* file justifying the time complexities of their respective implementations.

The fifth folder contains unit testing shit idfk what its gonna contain honestly AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA

These folders, with the exception of the `unit-tests` folder are standalone and the programs within them make no reference to files of other implementations.

<insert instructions on how to use unit tests and how to use the implementations>

## Code Structure
### Doubly linked list
### Dynamic array
### Skip list
### Sequence of trees

## Unit Test System
go jelo woo

## resources ig lmao
